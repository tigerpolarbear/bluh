title: Life, Simple
---

When you build a device, you build it with a purpose. You try to make it do the job well. You try to make it consistent. You try to make it so it doesn't wear out. You often try to simplify the device so it's easier for the end user, it takes the end user fewer steps. 

You probably want your device to deliver results quickly, but you want those results up to a certain level of quality. Consistency is part of quality.

A machine with fewer parts is, assuming all other factors are static, less likely to have problems or break down. If there are fewer the parts to check for wear or problems, this device is going to be easier to diagnos and fix as well. 

If the device can do fifty different things, but the user is only going to need two of them, then maybe this user was better off getting a different device, one with fewer parts, fewer options, fewer steps to the end result.

My lifestyle is a machine. In fact, it's a machine with too many fucking buttons, parts, steps, and problems too. I'm going to design a new machine. Let's look at some problematic parts of my collection:

- Dozens of large reference books and manuals that I never refer to
- Tonnes of small toys and trinkets
- A collection of Magic: The Gathering cards, though I do not play
- Ten or so pairs of shoes
- 30 or more t-shirts
- At least 6 pairs of pants
- Button-up dress shirts which I will _never_ wear
- Two bookshelves to store all this stuff
- Two skateboards, never ride them

I could continue, but it's not a very interesting list. I've decided to pare the fuck down. I'm putting a personal limit of one hundred possessions. Here's some stuff I'm going to get rid of:

- All of my furniture, including my bed (Though, I'm going to buy a new table/desk and chair.)
- Almost all of my clothes (I will only keep enough clothes so that I can go 5 days without doing laundry.)
- My entire book collection (I'm considering buying an e-book reader of some kind though.)
- My entire CD collection (First I'll finish ripping it.)
- Nearly all of the things I've kept for "emotional" reasons (I have attachment to only a few of them, and most are notes that will fit in a folder.)
- All game systems, and games, save my computer

Yet again, I could continue, but those are the big ones. I have one roommate, but my possessions will all be in my room, and they will fit into one Rubbermaid bin, and my backpacking pack, with the exception of my table, chair, and bike. Once I get rid of my stuff, I'll post a list for anyone who is curious.

Now, people seem to think this is pretty extreme. Why would I get rid of my bed and sleep on the floor? True, that doesn't appear to be totally practical, but I'm looking for a lifestyle that is as simple and minimal as possible. I want to get things done. I'm comfortable sleeping on a foam camping mat on the floor. A bed isn't necessary, makes me negligibly happier, and is going to be annoying next time I move. The same goes with the rest of the furniture; I don't need furniture to store things I didn't need in the first place.

When my life is simple, I am happy. Let's see how simple I can make it.
