title: I just made my first iPhone app!
---

In between trips to Vancouver, my real job, and all kinds of other shenanigans, I managed to sit down for a whole half-hour and run through Apple's delightful little "Hello, World" tutorial for iPhone app making. It was cute, seriously. Look at what I made!

That's pretty impressive, eh? I bet you wish you could do that. Yeah... no. Time to make a real app, I guess.
