title: Training Your Player

An important part of game design is the setup of the psychological payoffs that players derive enjoyment from. More difficult challenges punctuate the normal gameplay difficulty arc so that players can identify accomplishments, boosting enjoyment. So many games have two difficulty arcs: one for normal gameplay, and one for "bosses" or the like. 

As players work through the game, they should be getting better at the game. Lately I've been seeing a trend of games that, instead of forcing the player to improve, simply give them "bigger guns." This is not a very good alternative. The psychological payoff that a player can earn when their attention is drawn to the fact that they are taking on five of Mr. Generic-big-enemy instead just one can is extremely large. While earning a big gun is nice, players feels a strong sense of power when a game makes them aware of just how good they are at that game.

How can you incorporate this idea more fully into your game? You need to consciously design challenges that will make your player more prepared for problems he has already faced. You need to be subtle, because presenting a player with similar challenges ten times in a row, then giving him or her one that is ten times more difficult would make for a monotonous game. 

Say that you have a complex, intelligent, difficult enemy; you need to break down the skills that it takes to beat this enemy, and, once they've gotten past one of them, start testing the player on those skills. Make sure the player can do flawless mid-air grenade throws, or perfect sword lunges. Whatever it is, make the player do lots of them, so that they become part of the natural flow of the game. Tailoring regions or levels to a specific skill is something that games have been doing for a long time. The Legend of Zelda series is a perfect example of this kind of skill building.

Now that the player is great at the two or three tasks that they will require, go ahead and give them a challenge that they would not have been able to beat before. If you have design everything correctly, then your player should have been unaware of the skill-building exercises that they just went through, and be feeling pretty rad that they just fought three of the boss from two levels ago at once. 

Just a quick thought.
