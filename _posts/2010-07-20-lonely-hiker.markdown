title: Lonely Hiker!
---

Lonely Hiker is going to be the next game you buy for iPhone except for the awesome one that come out before it does! Inspired by a couple of clever mechanics that I worked into a game back in high school, Lonely Hiker will be a riveting tale about a singular hiker, off to save his favourite trail from hordes of rampaging machinery.

Seriously, it's going to be rad. I'm gonna throw in some killer-ass graphics and fistfuls of romping good retro tunes. You need to buy it as soon as it drops.

Stay lovely,
